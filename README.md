# Tradewinds

Tradewinds is a Minecraft mod about market economics and long-distance trade, inspired by trading games like *Taipan!* and *Elite Dangerous*.

Travel between villages, buy and sell goods, and become a filthy rich merchant prince!

## Planned features
* A simulated market for each village where you can buy and sell goods.
* Prices of goods vary depending on local supply and demand factors, as well as random events.
* Villages in different biomes will buy and sell different goods, configurable via datapacks.
* Higher level villagers will contribute more and better-quality goods to their village.
* Config options for everything.
* Integration with other mods like Minecraft Comes Alive.
